### What I learned

Through the development of this portfolio website, I deepened my understanding and proficiency in React. This project was an invaluable practice ground, allowing me to refine my React skills through hands-on application. Additionally, it introduced me to the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library, broadening my toolkit with its powerful scrolling animations. This experience not only enhanced my technical abilities in React and AOS but also improved my overall approach to designing and implementing interactive, user-friendly web interfaces.
